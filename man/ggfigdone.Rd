ggfigdone: Manage & Modify ggplot figures easily
}
\details{
When preparing a presentation or report, it is often necessary to manage a substantial number of ggplot figures.
Adjustments such as changing the figure size, modifying titles, labels, and themes may be required.
Returning to the original code to implement these changes can be inconvenient.
This package offers a straightforward method for managing ggplot figures.
Figures can be easily added to the database and subsequently updated using either a GUI (graphical user interface) and/or CLI (command line interface).
